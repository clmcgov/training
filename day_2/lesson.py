'''DAY 2
today we learn about sequences, dictionaries, and functions
'''

#First, we'll create a list.
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l
# [1, 2, 3]

#We can access elements of a list by position. Note that we start counting at
#zero
>>> l[0]
# 1
>>> l[1]
# 2

# a tuple is like a list
t = tuple(l)
t
# (1,2,3)
